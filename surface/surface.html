            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The planet is enveloped by a remarkably dense atmosphere with a thickness of approximately 135 kilometers. 
                This atmosphere is primarily composed of 57% ammonia and 33.55% methane, with trace amounts of nitrogen (5%), water vapor (3%), carbon dioxide (1%), and argon (0.45%).
                The high concentration of ammonia and methane, combined with the thick atmospheric layer, 
                results in an impenetrable barrier to sunlight, causing the planet's surface to remain in perpetual darkness.
            </p>
            <p>The atmospheric density generates extremely high pressure at the surface,
                while the lack of solar radiation contributes to an extremely cold surface temperature, averaging around -120Â°C. 
                Despite the insulating properties of the thick atmosphere, which would ordinarily moderate temperatures, 
                the absence of sunlight means that heat is not replenished, thus maintaining the planet's frigid conditions.

            <h2>Surface(Ice Crust Layer)</h2>
            <p>The ice crust layer is about <b>500-kilometers-thick</b>, primarily composed of frozen water, 
                along with other cryogenic substances such as frozen methane and ammonia. 
                This ice layer acts as a barrier, separating the harsh surface conditions from the more hospitable environment below. 
                The crust allows for limited thermal interaction between the planet's interior and its subsurface ocean, 
                contributing to the planet's geological and hydrological activity.

            <h2>Structure of Planet-X</h2>
            <p>The ocean, maintaining a stable temperature of approximately <b>10Â°C</b>, is sustained by the planet's internal thermal activity, 
                likely driven by geothermal processes, tidal forces, or chemical reactions within the core. 
                This stable thermal environment supports a unique chemosynthesis-based ecosystem, where organisms derive energy from chemical reactions rather than solar radiation.
            </p>
            <p>Hydrothermal vents located on the ocean floor supply essential nutrients, such as sulfide gases, necessary for the survival of chemosynthetic bacteria. 
                These bacteria, in turn, form the foundation of the ecosystem by converting chemical energy into organic compounds.
            </p>
            <p>The ecosystem comprises various specialized organisms adapted to this environment. 
                Filter feeders and grazers, such as vent sponges, rely on the chemosynthetic bacteria as a primary food source. Predatory species, including squid, 
                bioluminescent jellyfish-like glow worms, and sea-floor crawlers, inhabit areas around the vents, preying on the filter feeders and grazers.
