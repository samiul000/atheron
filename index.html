            <h2>Structure of Atheron X-10b</h2>
            <div class="Structure">

            </div>
            <p>
                The <b>Atheron X-23b</b> planet is characterized by a multi-layered structure, 
                which includes a dense atmosphere, a thick ice crust, a subsurface ocean, 
                and a core composed of silicate materials and a central core.
            </p>

            <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>The planet is enveloped by a dense atmosphere primarily composed of methane and ammonia, with trace amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor and nitrogen. 
                This thick atmosphere is impenetrable to sunlight, rendering the planet's surface perpetually dark. 
                The dense gases create high pressure and insulate the planet, but due to the lack of sunlight, 
                the surface temperature remains extremely cold, averaging around <b>-120¬∞C</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>Surface</h3>
            <p>Beneath the atmosphere is a <b>500-kilometers-thick</b> ice crust, primarily composed of frozen water, 
                along with other cryogenic substances such as frozen methane and ammonia. 
                This ice layer acts as a barrier, separating the harsh surface conditions from the more hospitable environment below. 
                The crust allows for thermal interaction between the planet's interior and its subsurface ocean, 
                contributing to the planet's geological and hydrological activity.
            </p>

            <h3>Ocean</h3>
            <p>Beneath the ice crust lies a subsurface ocean with a stable temperature of approximately <b>10¬∞C</b>. 
                This warmth is sustained by the planet's internal thermal activity, likely driven by geothermal processes, tidal forces, or chemical reactions within the core. 
                The ocean supports a chemosynthesis-based ecosystem, where life forms derive energy from chemical reactions rather than sunlight. 
                Hydrothermal vents at the ocean floor provide the necessary nutrients and energy sources, making this ocean a haven for unique forms of life & ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h3>Silicate Core</h3>
            <p>Below the ocean lies a silicate core composed of rocky materials. 
                This core is partially differentiated and exhibit volcanic activity, which helps maintain the ocean's temperature and provides essential minerals. 
                The core's geological activity has a crucial factor in sustaining the chemosynthetic life forms that rely on the planet's internal energy sources.
            </p>

            <h3>Central Core</h3>
            <p>At the planet's center lies a dense central core, composed of metals such as iron and nickel. 
                Depending on the planet's internal dynamics, this core is partially molten. 
                The core might contribute to the planet's overall heat production, driving the processes that sustain the subsurface ocean and its ecosystem.

            <h2>Atheron X-23b</h2>
            <p>Atheron X-23b is an exoplanet located approximately 200 million kilometers away from its parent star, a red dwarf. 
                The planet is notable for its dense atmosphere composed primarily of methane and ammonia, creating an opaque layer that blocks nearly all light from its star. 
                The surface temperature of Atheron X-23b hovers around -120¬∞C (-184¬∞F), contributing to its extensive ice coverage.
            </p>
            <p>The planet's surface is covered by a 500-kilometer-thick ice layer, beneath which lies a subsurface ocean with a temperature of approximately 10¬∞C (50¬∞F). 
                This ocean is kept warm by geothermal activity from Atheron X-23b's thermally active core. 
                Atheron X-23b is 30% larger and 25% heavier than Earth. 
                The combination of its distance from its star and its atmospheric composition contributes to its extreme conditions and icy environment.
